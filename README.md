horse2zebras Cycle GAN (weights included). [ENG]

Dataset
-----------------------------------
As a dataset, I chose a dataset from the UC Berkeley website that was designed specifically for cycleGAN. It is downloaded directly to your laptop via [the following link](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/horse2zebra.zip).

The dataset is divided into 4 parts in advance (folders):
1. testA (120 Files)
2. testB (140 Files
3. trainA (1,067 Files)
4. trainB (1,334 Files)

`A-files - horses, B-files - zebras.`
